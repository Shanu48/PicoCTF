# Easy 1

## The one time pad can be cryptographically secure, but not when you know the key. Can you solve this? We've given you the encrypted flag, key, and a table to help UFJKXQZQUNB with the key of SOLVECRYPTO. Can you use this table to solve it?.

In the question, UFJKXQZQUNB looks like our encrypted text

SOLVECRYPTO is the key

We also have been given a table in table.txt

This question can be solved manually using the given table, but we also have the key so we can directly use Videnere decoding
